# Description

Community jailbreak toolkit in it's infancy. Project will likely be renamed once I figure out what it is.

#### Not for users. This is (currently) a developer-only tool. 

## Goal

Not quite sure yet

### Current support

Nothing. Literally nothing. Enabling debug=YES; in ViewController.m will kernel panic devices <13.3.

## Credits

This project is based off of rootlessJB. At the moment it should be considered a fork.
